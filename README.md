## About the project

Project [here](https://avoltereading.surge.sh)

This is still a WIP which is mostly being done on the refactor branch, being it the "superior" version (in my opinion :P)

What seems like a very simple project helped me understand how important the user experience can be. The project being somewhat personal helped me focus on trying to deliver specific feelings with the use of colour, animations and/or by even adding limitations aimed to slow the pace of the presentation.

I went through an initial iteration of building this presentation which was working fine, but I later refactored its code on a different branch in order to have more readable/reusable code.

### Motivation

This project has been created with the objective of implementing modular javascript (revealing module pattern), CSS3 animations and animate.css.

... But my biggest motivation was *her*! ![aw shucks](http://res.cloudinary.com/forgoroe/image/upload/c_scale,w_106/v1490269236/e9c40ab4433308638e74cd4f16244548_fileoh-stop-it-you-wrapped-aww-shucks-memes_400-400_ozaroq.jpg)
